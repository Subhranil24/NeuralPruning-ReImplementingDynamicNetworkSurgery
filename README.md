# Neural Pruning- ReImplementing Dynamic Network Surgery
This paper tries to re-implements significants portions of paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04493 see below for citation). However, lack of impormation about the thresholding makes its extremely difficult to reproduce the results as mentioned in the paper.
